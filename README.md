## Hi there, I'm Juliana! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer with more than 30 years experience, last 25 years with Delphi.

I am passionate about writing clear, concise and reusable code. 

Currently studying using the FreeCodeCamp Full-Stack Developer curriculum, learning to use Git and GitHub, and brushing up on my SQL Server skills.
